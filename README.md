4. Move rbbx_combiner.py to "C:\"

5. Move Combine_rbbx.cmd to "%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo"
   * Note: To get to the SendTo folder, youâ€™ll need to open up an Explorer window, and then paste that weird looking address into the address bar
   * %APPDATA% is an environment variable that actually maps to something like C:\users\<username>\AppData\Roaming.
